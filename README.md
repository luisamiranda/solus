# Solus

A homepage that cares: Solus asks how your day is going, and tries to complement your mood with images, colour, and optional sound. The page will talk back to the user to refine understanding of her mood.

# Uses the Web Speech API

Solus uses modern computer (and mobile) browsers' access to microphone and speakers to talk to its user. It takes in the results and compares them to grammar sets about mood to set the background.

# Future Roadmap

In the future, Solus would like to:

* pull the user's itunes music and create a mood-based station
* open with each new tab
* subtly change colours with the time of day
* remember/learn about an individual over time
* have longer, more meaningful conversations
* offer additional widgets such as weather
* have a user panel to refine voice style, et al.
